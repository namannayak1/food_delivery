# YUMIFY

"Yumify: Bringing Culinary Joy to Your Doorstep!"

📱 With Yumify, users can easily order their favorite fast foods from the comfort of their own home. The app features a sleek and user-friendly interface, making it convenient for anyone to use.

🔒 The first step to using Yumify is creating an account. The app has a secure login and registration page connected with Firebase, ensuring the safety of user information.

📍 Once logged in, users can save their address for quick and easy ordering in the future. No more typing in your address every time you want to order your go-to meal!

🍴 Yumify also offers individual categorization for different fast foods, making it easier for users to find what they're craving. From burgers to pizza to fries, Yumify has it all.

🌙 For those who prefer a darker interface, Yumify also has a dark mode feature. This not only looks sleek, but it also reduces eye strain for users who order food late at night.

🛒 After selecting their desired food, users can add it to their cart and proceed to the payment gateway. Yumify offers a seamless payment process, where users can fill in their card details and a complete bill will be generated.

🚚 Once the order is placed, a delivery boy will be assigned to ensure timely and efficient delivery. No more waiting in long lines or dealing with busy phone lines - Yumify makes food delivery hassle-free.
